Controls:
  * Left, Right, or HJKL, Page Up, Page Down: change slide.

You can alternatively use a presenter. `tslide` works with the Logitech R800 and R400 out of the box.

# Usage

```
tslide README.markdown
```

each slide is a section of a markdown document,
separated a line with `---` (markdown for horizontal rule `<hr>`)
you will notice that this README.md is a valid tslide markdown presentation.

## Why?

I initially wrote this 2 hours before a talk I had to give.
since then, I have given many presentations with it,
and received a number of contributions that has made tslide actually pretty good,
